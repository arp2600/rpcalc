Binary Operators: drops the stack size by one
	+
	-
	*
	/
	%
	^

Unary Operators: changes the element on top of the stack
	sin
	cos
	tan
	sinh
	cosh
	tanh
	rnd
	sqrt

dup 		-		duplicate the top element
swp			-		swap the top two elements
dump		-		print out the stack
drop		-		decrements the head, dropping the top value in the stack (leaves the value in place)
catch		-		increment the head, catching a value previously dropped

To do:
	Revise the whole thing to work with an ncurses interface
		The state of the stack could be shown in a bar at the bottom, and the command history could scroll down the page
		Using ncurses would make it all more portable as well
